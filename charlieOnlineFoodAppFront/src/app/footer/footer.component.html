    <h2>About us</h2>

    <p>
        A restaurant, or, more informally, an eatery, is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to
        customers.[1] Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and
        food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of
        cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias, to mid-priced family
        restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.

        In Western countries, most mid-to high-range restaurants serve alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine. Some
        restaurants serve all the major meals, such as breakfast, lunch, and dinner (e.g., major fast food chains,
        diners, hotel restaurants, and airport restaurants). Other restaurants may serve only a single meal (for
        example, a pancake house may only serve breakfast) or they may serve two meals (e.g., lunch and dinner).
